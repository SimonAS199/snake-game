This is my own take on Snake, it's the first game I ever built. I used HTML CSS and plain JS to create this project.

Currently I'm trying to get better at front-end-devlopment. I thought it would be a great idea to build a simple game like Snake so I could challenge my DOM-Manipulation skills I've learned so far. 

I had no problems getting to where I am now. My Snake is moving correctly, collision detection works properly and I'm satisfyed with the simple design. I tried to keep my code somewhat clean. But as I said, I'm a beginner so best practices are none of my business yet. Just trying to get things to work ^^

Once the basecomponents of my game were done I tried appending new bodyparts to the snake-array. Works perfectly except it doesn't. I can push the new parts (which are basically always an exact copy of the last part in my array) to the array. My plan from here on out, is to update the position of every new bodypart everytime my gamestate gets updated.

For example: 
I'd like snake[1] to move to the position snake[0] occupied the interval before, snake[2] to the position [3] occupied and so on..

I just cant figure out how to do this. I tried lots of different things but nothing seems to work. 

Should I start over and take a completely new approach or do you think there is a solution to my problem working with the code I have now?

I would really appreciate any help.

I stopped working on the project due to frustration. I'm probably not good enough yet. Comming back to it one I accquired the necessary skills.
